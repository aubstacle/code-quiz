# JavaScript Code Quiz


## Description
Welcome to my Javascript Code Quiz!! I was asked to create a multiple choice coding quiz with the following acceptance criteria:

GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score

Unfortunately I couldn't fully get the local storage score saving functionality to fully work without breaking the rest of the application, so it is not included currently.

deployed application: https://aubstacle.github.io/code-quiz-apolk/.

Huge shoutout to the youtuber Web Dev Simplified for his instructional video on building multiple choice quizzes for Javascript (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riDzcEQbX6k&list=WL&index=2&t=0s). It really helped me get started with the HTML and CSS, and also helped me start grasping the way the functions should be declared.
